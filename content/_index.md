This free online book covers basic data types and variables, 
functions, control flow, simple matching, and file I/O. Each chapter starts with a 
set of learning objectives, and ends with a copy of all 
code written up to that point. 

After completing this book, you'll be ready to tackle more 
advanced Rust topics that have been purposefully omitted from 
this book, like lifetimes, structs, methods, and traits.
