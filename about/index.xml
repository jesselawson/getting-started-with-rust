Markdown is a minimalistic language for writing HTML content very quickly. It gives us the ability to write text-based documents that are legible and small, while compiling into vaid HTML. It makes drafting, updating, and publishing very easy, and is a common tool used among programmers in all lines of work.
A Markdown compiler&amp;rsquo;s job is to convert &amp;ldquo;markdown&amp;rdquo; content into valid HTML.</description></item><item><title>Special thanks</title><link>https://jesselawson.github.io/getting-started-with-rust/about/thanks/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jesselawson.github.io/getting-started-with-rust/about/thanks/</guid><description>Many people have reached out with helpful feedback to improve this book.
