You&amp;rsquo;ve created a working CLI tool that converts Markdown to HTML, and you wrote it all yourself. I&amp;rsquo;m proud of you!
I hope that this experience has helped you build confidence with Rust so that you are well-equipped mentally and emotionally to start tackling some of the more difficult aspects of this really fun and unique language.
Looking for what to work on next? Consider trying one of the challenges!</description></item><item><title>Challenges</title><link>https://jesselawson.github.io/getting-started-with-rust/chapter6/next/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jesselawson.github.io/getting-started-with-rust/chapter6/next/</guid><description>I hope you&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed this experience with Rust, because if you don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy it at this point I really don&amp;rsquo;t think you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy what comes after this: traits and lifetimes and, depending on what you&amp;rsquo;re building, mutexes and unsafe and all sorts of little goodies. We&amp;rsquo;ve really only begun to scratch the surface of what you can do with Rust!
As far as our tiny Markdown compiler goes, I&amp;rsquo;ve added some challenges below for you to continue on your journey.</description></item></channel></rss>
